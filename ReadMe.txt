# Shellcode-Development

Code is completing the following request

Task: This is 64-bit shellcode. Namely, instead of executing "/bin/sh", we need to execute "/bin/bash", and we are not allowed to use any redundant / in the command string, i.e., the length of the command must be 9 bytes (/bin/bash). Please demonstrate how you can do that. In addition to showing that you can get a bash shell, you also need to show that there is no zero in your code.
